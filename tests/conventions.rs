//! The conventions no cargo subcommand can check.
//!
//! Several of them:  eighty characters a line, the licence header on every
//! hand-written file, prose written in British English with English Spacing,
//! exactly one space after a semicolon, a category opening every commit
//! subject, and the version examples matching the manifest.  The prose rules
//! were enforced by two Python scripts until 2026-08-23; a Rust repository
//! should hold Rust, so they are a test harness now.
//!
//! Four of these tests check the checker rather than the repository.  A
//! checker which reports nothing is worthless until it has been shown to
//! report something, and the Python original earned that lesson twice; a
//! fourth confirms the checker leaves the changelog RON files alone.
//!
//! Prose living outside the repository — the session reports — is held to the
//! same conventions by naming it in `CONVENTIONS_EXTRA_PROSE`, colon
//! separated.  Only the language check reads it; a report's tables are wider
//! than eighty characters by nature, but its semicolons obey the one-space
//! rule like any source.
